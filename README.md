## Introduction
- This project is introduced in the book "PYTHON CRASH COURSE" - project 3 (Web Application )
- I use this project for learning Django 

## Spec 
- Original Spec : 
    We’ll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to 
log the topics they’re interested in and to make journal entries as 
they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page will 
describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. Once 
logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, and read 
and edit existing entries.
